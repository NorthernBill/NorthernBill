- 👋 Hi, I’m @NorthernBill
- 👀 I’m interested in Portal speedrunning, developing a new version of the game Portal 2
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal's Blueprint system
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that might get scrapped because Valve might say "you ain't making Portal Refreshed dude"
- 📫 How to reach me - YOU CAN'T MWAHAHAHAAA
- ⚡ Fun fact: uhh IDK ... plecos are weird 👍
